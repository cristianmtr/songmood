\f0\fs32 \cf0 All around me are familiar faces\uc0\u8232 Worn out places, worn out faces\u8232 Bright and early for the daily races\u8232 Going nowhere, going nowhere\
Their tears are filling up their glasses\uc0\u8232 No expression, no expression\u8232 Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow\u8232 No tomorrow, no tomorrow\
And I find it kind of funny\uc0\u8232 I find it kind of sad\u8232 The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\u8232 I find it hard to tell you,\u8232 I find it hard to take\u8232 When people run in circles it's a very, very\u8232 Mad world, mad world\
Children waiting for the day they feel good\uc0\u8232 Happy birthday, happy birthday\u8232 And to feel the way that every child should\u8232 Sit and listen, sit and listen\
Went to school and I was very nervous\uc0\u8232 No one knew me, no one knew me\u8232 Hello teacher tell me, what's my lesson?\u8232 Look right through me, look right through me\
And I find it kind of funny\uc0\u8232 I find it kind of sad\u8232 The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\u8232 I find it hard to tell you,\u8232 I find it hard to take\u8232 When people run in circles it's a very, very\u8232 Mad world, mad world, mad world, mad world}
