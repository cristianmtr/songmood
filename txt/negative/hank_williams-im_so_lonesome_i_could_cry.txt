\f0\fs26 \cf0 \cb2 Hear that lonesome whippoorwill\
He sounds too blue to fly\
The midnight train is whining low\
I'm so lonesome I could cry\
I've never seen a night so long\
When time goes crawling by\
The moon just went behind the clouds\
To hide its face and cry\
Did you ever see a robin weep\
When leaves begin to die?\
Like me, he's lost the will to live\
I'm so lonesome I could cry\
The silence of a falling star\
Lights up a purple sky\
And as I wonder where you are\
I'm so lonesome I could cry\
