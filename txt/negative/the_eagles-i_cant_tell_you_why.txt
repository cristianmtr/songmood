\f0\fs26 \cf0 \cb2 Look at us baby, up all night \
Tearing our love apart \
Aren't we the same two people who live \
through years in the dark? \
Ahh... \
Every time I try to walk away \
Something makes me turn around and stay \
And I can't tell you why \
When we get crazy, \
it just ain't to right, \
(try to keep you head, little girl) \
Girl, I get lonely, too \
You don't have to worry \
Just hold on tight \
(don't get caught in your little world) \
'Cause I love you \
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see \
We make it harder than it has to be \
and I can't tell you why \
no, baby, I can't tell you why \
I can't tell you why \
No, no, baby, I can't tell you why \
I can't tell you why \
I can't tell you why}
