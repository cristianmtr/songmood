\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 Hanging around with my mates one night\
We got in a little fight\
Geezer come with a knife in his fist\
I got cut along with the wrist said\
A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B.\
All cops are bastards\
Coppers come up & say what's the matter with you?\
now they see what we can do\
Next thing I knew I was in a cell\
all my mates are in there as well\
A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B.\
All cops are bastards\
I had a court date to plead my case\
they had delight at the look in my face\
they said we're gonna put you away\
I said all I had to say\
A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B.\
All cops are bastards}
