Hanging around with my mates one night
We got in a little fight
Geezer come with a knife in his fist
I got cut along with the wrist said
A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B.
All cops are bastards
Coppers come up & say what's the matter with you?
now they see what we can do
Next thing I knew I was in a cell
all my mates are in there as well
A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B.
All cops are bastards
I had a court date to plead my case
they had delight at the look in my face
they said we're gonna put you away
I said all I had to say
A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B., A.C.A.B.
All cops are bastards
