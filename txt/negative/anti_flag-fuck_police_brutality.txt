A bunch of punks hangin' out on the streets before a show
Patty wagon pulls up -instinct- "Run Man, let's just go!"
Cop chases them through the streets and then they go inside
They run into a show where maybe they can hide
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
He hides just standing in the crowd there's nowhere he can run
The cop comes up behind him and cracks him with a gun
Drags his bloody ass outside and throws him to the ground
"There's nowhere left to take you boy you're already downtown"
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
But the cops can do no wrong
They can kill, they can rape, they can do what they want,
But the cops can do no wrong
We've got to fight, take back the right,
The cops are just like Hitler's Third Reich, do what they want
Who do we fear? Who do we trust? How do we know?
Who do we fear? Who do we trust? How do we know?

FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY!
