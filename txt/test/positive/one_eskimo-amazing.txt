I feel sweet, do you feel sweet? It's amazing
I have no skin and I feel everything, it's amazing
I feel good when you feel good
I knew I would and it's amazing
I've wanted this for so long
Now the deed has been done
We shall rise with the sun
And spend our time as one
Now there is no sin in anything
And it's amazing
I love life, I hope you do too
'Cause I love everything, it's all amazing
I feel you, do you feel you?
I understand when they say we're born again
'Cause I feel born again
I'm born again and it's amazing
And it's the best thing, it's glorious
It's life changing, this feeling is amazing
It's the best thing, it's glorious
It's life changing, this feeling
This feeling, oh
This feeling, it's amazing
It's in the stars, in the sun
It's everywhere, in everyone
And it will be every day
From now on, from now on
We are one and it's amazing
It's in the stars, in the sun
It's everywhere, in everyone
And it will be every day
From now on, from now on
We are one and it's amazing
It's in the stars, in the sun
It's everywhere, in everyone
And it will be every day
From now on, from now on
We are one and it's amazing
