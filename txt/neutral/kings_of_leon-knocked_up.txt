I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a coupe De ville
She buckled up on navy
She don't care what her mama said, no
She's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all i have to take
This takings gonna shape me
People call us renegades
'cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
Some people getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says, no
I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other
And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're gonna go?
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
People call us renegades
Feel like we're living crazy
We like taking on the town
Some people getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says, no
I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other
And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're gonna go?
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where?
They gonna call us renegades, woah, oh, oh
Feel like we're living on this town, woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And I don't care if you don't win
I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a coupe De ville
She buckled up on navy
She don't care what her mama said, no
She's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take
This takings gonna shape me
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
