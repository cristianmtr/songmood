I'm an alien from another sphere.
The thing I like about the earth is the range of colors.
Fantastic to mundane. Brilliant to dull.
As I was penetrating the ozone, I perchanced to notice the orange peel-like quality of the light playing upon the... the ocean.
I gotta go right now; someone is videotaping me in my spaceship.
All around a water tank
Just a-waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Just a-waitin' for'n the rain
I walked up to a breakman
Just to give him a line of talk
He said, "If you got money,
I'll see that you don't walk."
"I haven't got a nickel;
Not a penny for to show."
"Get off, get off, you railroad bum!"
And he slammed the boxcar door
They let me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
The moon, the stars above me... and what else?
