[mimicking bass line] Bicka bicka bow bow bow,
Bicka bow bow bump bump
What, what, what, what
Hah hah hah hah
Unh,
On your mark ready set let's go
Dance floor pro I know you know
I go psycho when my new joint hit
Just can't sit
Gotta get jiggy wit it
Ooh that's it
Now honey honey come ride
DKNY all up in my eye
You gotta Prada bag with alotta stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin
Everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid
Wishin' they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Givin' up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my car-dee-o is Infinit-
Ha ha
Big Willie Style's all in it
Gettin' Jiggy Wit It
What you wanna ball with the kid
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama-unh mama-unh mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, unh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser
DJ play another
From the prince of this
Your highness
Only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the west to the east to the north
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off
Ah yes yes y'all ya don't stop
In the winter or the (summertime)
I makes it hot
Gettin jiggy wit 'em
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop
Who else Will Smith
Livin' that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me
Give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezy
Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum
Never see Will attackin' 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and um,
Flatten 'em
Psyche
Kiddin'
You thought I took a spill
But I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hittin'
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me
Don't be silly
Getting jiggy wit it
Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the Caress on your hand
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question, if the prodda dressin and the Gucci
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever
I wanna stay with you forever
I wanna spend all my life with only you
I wanna stay, lets stay together
Chasing forever, with only you
Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
Fore I die I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
Havin more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever
Yo
When I released my first single back in like '86
People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them
Bangin' out them multi-plastic still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing
Take your place allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from west Philly
Thought I was whack 'cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
The ill kid
Hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me
Really don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Operah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada
Vertex is me the magnanamous
God you sayin' damn I've always been a fan of his
Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't
Look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't
Just don't say nothing
Man I love being me ready to rock the block
With some more hot top notch - for you to cop
No more mr. nice guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(he soft he whack man that ain't real rap)
You beleive that
It hurt me at first but it's cool
Took the insults feed it to my ego for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out
Did you see it's that brother from
Now can I please get
Sure you can miss
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private
And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't
Just don't say nothing
Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
I'm about to show you how a man like me works
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seater
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probobly a couple
Of elbows
Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film fests to vos and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so-called friends who been nothing but actors
You're way of carachter but now who's the bomb
It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed
Y'all know what it is
Ah damn that's right y'all don't
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't
Just don't say nothing
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Miami, uh, uh
Southbeach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the base and the sunset glow
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Buenvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'ma scoot me somethin hot
In this south-sea merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas, with the hot mommies
Screamin (Aii poppy)
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your door
We flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
An New York is the city that we know don't sleep
An we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mierda, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home
Yes
At the start of the new jiggyness
With the Trackmasters
Camp Lo and
Willie
Gon' give it to ya
Know what I mean
Lot of macoronis here
Check it out for all the
Tenderonis
Ah ha ha
Like chatchy and joni
Lights camera action
The hip-hop attraction
Fresh Priggy
John Bliggy
Player haters been hatin' all my playin' for years
Now they seein' they worst fears as I bathe in cheers
Parades and accolades
All shades and ages
It's me the outrageous
My zeal contageous
The smile inspirator
Aspen to Grenada
One of the only mc's to say cheese with Scharwtzenegger
Everywhere I go they know me
Planet Hollywood in Paris accidently spilt a drink upon they ??
Truth of the matter I've been loungin'
Livin' it up givin' it up
In monopulate surrondings
Been around the world and I-yi-yi
Ain't seen enough of this fly-yi-yi
My attitude pervasive
My effervensence
Bringing you back to the essence
With the...
Yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Mic check y'all
And ya don't quit
'bout to slay you worst than the first verse
Packin' my purse but yo without one curse
I survive in rarified air where only few can live
Thoughts in my brain like that train in the fugitive
I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game
Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name
A rose by any other still beautifies the room
So don't get consumed when a brother's known to gloom
It's amantics but yo it's really good to be back
Never racing the rap just lacing the track
Not sarendipadee with me it was a plan b
'bout to have an oscar standin' next to my grammiesss
Plural mucho no need to talk though
I'm a just do so
I'm comin' at ya with the smoothest slickness
Behold the style lick of this kickin'...
A GQ cover twice
This brother's nice
Vanity fair you saw me there
I discovered life
Outside of rap got the cream and all that
But kinda left a void in me
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
Said my mic
Aight
Pump your radio you could record
As they place my welcome mat at the music awards
Coming throgh America tinted in high beams
Rose petals at my feet like I'm Prince Akeem
So to all you player haters while y'all sayin' y'all rhyme
Please stop sayin' Jada cause that name's mine
I rocked the Philly fade with the divin' waves
Yes yallin' till I'm bald like Issac Hayes
Bad eyes or greys back pain or bad legs
I'm a get better with age trust
It's all good, pop the bubbly, life is lovely
All sun no rain
No strain, can't complain
Pass Hell pain, but no Coumbaya
Now I Boomshaka-laka-laka Boo-ah-ah
I got the good life, no strife, real nice
An I'm a papa my son Trey haha
An when I'm on tour, he be mad I'm gone
But then he smile an come runnin screamin "daddy's home"
Then he hold me, slightly tightly
Mom, your wish came true-I got one just like me
My life be so good, so good
Ka-chicka-chicka Ka-chicka-chicka-good
Things come to those who wait
But too late my life's to great to wait
I wanna, celebrate good times, c'mon
Livin lovin, lovin livin, it's all good
I'm lovin livin, it's all good
Livin lovin, lovin livin, it's all good
I wake up every morning in the canopy bed
Slip a kiss to the Miss, you the man she says
Mirror, mirror, need I call?
You know, uno, bad breath an all
Times I been fed up, still didn't let up
'Stead a doin dirt, did work and kept my head up
Set up
For the future, much love to my girl
North Pole got my butt cold (sittin on top of the world)
An I'm feelin (so high)
Touch the ceiling (the sky)
You say I smile cause I'm on top of the pie
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
My grin got longevity, got family backin me
That's why I'm livin happily
Ever after, love and laughter
Hussle cause I wants to, not cause I have to
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?
FP, the phenomenon, true Don Juan, Jon Blaze
The Fonz ain't seen my Happy Days
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin a phrase
They say the clothes don't make the man
Take my hand
Watch me freak this
Ah-mommy's tryin ta creep this
Tryin to entice me to let it off
But nah, (why not?) c'mon baby, you saw Set It Off
Proposition by trio, in Rio
Menage Trois, down at the Marde Gras
But nah, my clothes by Versace
My attitude cocky, the sym- it's Imanyaki
Like a felon, no tellin what I do next
I don't front cause I'm paid, but I do flex
Southwestern, crib like a villa
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla
An it's real clear
Y'all talkin East and West, I'm talkin hemispheres
My papa raised no fool
So many zeros on my check it's like, oooooooooooohh
Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entoruage
Hard to camaflouge when you livin' this large
I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down the fifteen
My whole auroa gleamin'
Who that kid in the green v
Envy brother schemin'
I ain't thinkin' bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m.
With my speakers tweakin'
Freakin' off this weekend
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight
Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doin' it
(you know it's Big Willie style)
I'm in a five star casino shuttin' crap tables down (boom)
Non bettin' willie watchers standin' around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civllians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit
It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representin' like it's ladies night
Comin' right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful
Sportin' hot pink
Rocks in the link
In the drop with a mink
Like my - don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passin'
Breakin' you down like fractions
While we be rappin' about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen
With mademouselle from gezals to versace
With a sweet smell
This female leadin' the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill
Is it a mans thing for real
Can us girls roll wit yall
What the deal
Well now it's lookin' like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name
Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matchin' gators
Swervin' lane
In pole position rolling deep like a co-malition
In soul poisition and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew lookin' clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P.
Eating grapes under the A.C.
Big willie style is how we do it
Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
