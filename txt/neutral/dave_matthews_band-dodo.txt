Once upon a time
When the world was just a pancake
Fears would arise
That if you went too far, you'd fall
But with the
Passage of time
It all became more of a ball
We're as sure of that
As we all once were when the world was flat
So I wonder this
As life billows smoke inside my head
This little game
Where nothing is sure (oh)
Why would you play by the rules?
Who did, you did, you
Who did, you did, you
When was it killed
The very last dodo bird
And was she aware
She was the very last one
So I wonder this
As life billows smoke inside my head
This little game
Where nothing is sure (oh)
Why would you play by the rules?
Who did, you did, you
Who did, you did, you
You say who did, you did, you
If all the things that you are saying now
Were true enough but still what is all the worrying about
We can work it out
We can work it out
Oh I wonder this
As life billows smoke inside my head
This little game
Where nothing is sure (oh)
Why would you play by the rules?
Who did, you did, you
Who did, you did, you
You say who did, you did, you
