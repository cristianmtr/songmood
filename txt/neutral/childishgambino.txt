I do not, I do not, I am just, I am just a rapper
Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet being empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain
And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening
I'm a try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzy Bear, what the fuck
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I'm no better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (be a rapper) 
Whoa
What'd you get, amnesia?
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or something
And my bank balance were around a grand or something
Ask you something:
Do you think I'm common like sense it?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend
Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the tin man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the lean time don't come crying for the thin man
In the mean time I'll be building my portfolio
All these other dudes eradicated like polio
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks
I bet you wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone
Now I'm all gassed up like Exxon
Girls see the money like I fucking got checks on
I don't even know if this girl really likes me
Picking up the check like I'm working at Nike
Talking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me
Then I find out she's trying to break in the industry
That's really lame
I still hit it
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
I'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me
Yes, homie I'm a man of my word
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd
And, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
I know my girl out there somewhere
And if you hear this, you should come here
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here
Y'all know the name
No action, all flame
It's D to the C, no practice, all game
And not the game that your computer came installed with
So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with
The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins
Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us
It's all about us
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
Til then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars
Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude
Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster
I stopped talking I'm tired of paying em lip service
Switched over from street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish
And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are
Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star
APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts
Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt
When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this
A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this
These guys aren't tough-n-stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But, the chips are down, because I put them there
And I got a hot chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only goal that I have is my Emmy bitch
Yes, and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it
See the other side of it
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could I ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And I go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me because I had to, now a nigga like to
Cause I get cheese like the mice do
I am a work of art, Crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stop sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo
Sleeping on a Cow Pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, I'm a ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush
I really think I like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands
"Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud
And set the bed alight and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even louder"
This is all fun, yeah, my work is Vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free downloading
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick, indie, black chick, double stuffed Oreo
Make I shit rapped pissed off like a urinal
You can not see me, I can change your prospective
Sick boy, click. That's an Animal Collective
Fuckin' with your world, like I don't need protection
I am just a rapper, I'm in such a perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah, my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy tail, I've earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight till that rec spin
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Every nigga have and hit, and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, I'm a change it all up
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird Souffl√© and the noise makes me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shot gun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to
Cause the used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga mother fucker turn your eyes on
I am so different, you don't even know the half of
I do not talk, mother fucker I'm a Rapper! 
Bitch, get to know me
If you don't like this shit I'm puttin' out, then you can blow
These dollars in my pocket gettin' big, I gotta fold it
It's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni
What the fuck is going on?
I'm in her bush. Before I eat, I make her mow the lawn
My career is like award shows, it's going long
I make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong
Bitch, get to know me
I do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe
I'm walking weird cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on
Let me slow it down a sec
Man, I can't not not be sick
Hook me up with Dimetapp
Bitch, get to know me
You think you better than I am, then show me
These niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them
And I let them, cause they know if you reply, then you respect them
I've been working for a minute. Ho, this album's a success
I'm not tryin' to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best
Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches
I would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches
Bitch, get to know me
I'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me
That nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain
All I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game
This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?
Bitch, get to know me
Half-price flat screens. Yes, I work for Sony
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit
They tryin' hard to hate me, I just don't understand it
Screamin' at me, when you gonna stick to the right business
And stop making rap music for these white kidses?
Huh, I make music for these tight kids
Don't be a fucking asshole. One day, you'll have to wipe his
Bitch, get to know me
I know what I am, and I'll never be HOV-y
Cause I am just different. I'm being what I am, man
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us
Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius
You talk from far away because my money in between us
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chillin' with Aaliyah
Bitch, get to know me
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you aren't around, can't speak
I can't speak
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have, isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work
So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
Cause
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I‚Äôm the best when I‚Äôm a-ffection-ate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that
But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô awesome 
Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage
Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin'
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fr-Fred Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin'
Down the Ryan, in a Scion
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run cause I got warrants, but it's cool I got endurance
It's cool I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
I'm tired of McDonalds, when a chick that cook chicano
That can't speak a lick of English, and pronounce my name like Chano
She say something something Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I know"
Tonight, I'ma make decisions for life
It's a Lucy Boomer dark lookin' light, some might drive
That's that shit right there that I don't like
There that shit just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shots for the niggas that's here right now
And shots to the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
Shit, that and A with alize
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday night
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary
