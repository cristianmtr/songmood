Yeah,
And I swear to never let this moment pass me
I give it my all on these tracks like an athlete
Made it to the pros and they salary capped me
Mum said I should've stayed in school - Degrassi
Sorry Drizzy I just made it to the college path
But things ain't even adding up like it was college math
So gimme a minute to figure and I holla back
Where the non-believers, fuck 'em, I never acknowledge that.
Knocking on the door. Jehovah's my witness.
And I'm forever gone so Hova will witness
I'm over my business, I'm entrepreneur-shit
'Cause she's my investment and damnit it's gorgeous
Can't get caught up in this world but I love it
A lot of people throwing in their hands like they puppets
All that shit change when the drum kicks
Shia labeouf transforming what we do into dumb hits
You know that I gotta go chasing my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh not me. Oh oh not me.
You know that I gotta go chasing my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh not me. Oh oh not me.
I never can say goodbye
Know know know know why
I never can say goodbye
Look I'm being honest sometimes it's easy to burn out
When you don't really know how the future will turn out
I been in school so they one thing that I learned now
Is that all the work I'm putting in will equal what I earn out
And that's just economics in the perfect universe
A place where every girl I meet is saying you the first
And the crowd is singing with me like they knew the verse
Thank the lord for gravity - it's grabbing me into the Earth
So even though I wanna be a star sun
I can never leave my town like a pardon
Because it made me who I am - Bar none
Tell Long Island I'm a burn it down like arson
So we can raise it back up like it's our son
Make 'em play our song every day like it's parson
Came a long way but I still feel far
I hope they understand how real we are.
You know that I gotta go chasing my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh not me. Oh oh not me.
You know that I gotta go chasing my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh not me. Oh oh not me.
I never can say goodbye
Know know know know why
I never can say goodbye
Uh You know the feeling when the buzz on vibrate
Spanish girls say I'm one fine hombre
What could be better than this? Baby 'cause I'm great.
Take 'em out to dinner - it didn't matter if I'm late
'Cause you'll wait. I don't even play son
Ain't no competition - I got the race won
Haters want to shoot me down with they ray guns
I pull out the ray-bans - you ain't gonna say nuh'in.
You know that I gotta go chasing my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh not me. Oh oh not me.
You know that I gotta go chasing my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh not me. Oh oh not me.
I never can say goodbye
Know know know know why
I never can say goodbye
Oh, wake up on the beach now
Yeah
We everywhere you wanna be now
Yep
I just had a dream - I could be a grown up
Friends telling me I'm a pop like soda
Wild summer night, well some of you woulda known
A kid like moi woulda blown up
Chilling out east
Gotta rock Lola
Only fair matters like I'm Carl Winslo, But
Pop in the road trip
I got the windows low shit
We're doin this for kicks - I'm Matt Stompra
And when that's over I don't wanna quick ending
And then moneys so cool while you quit that spending
Girs do yoga they just split and bending
If you acting sinister then quit pretending
Oh that's offending me why don't you cover up
Cause I could show you to my room get you bundled up
She took a look into my pocket got 100 bucks
I crash landed in the country club cause I got'Cause I got
Friends in the bank, friends in the Hamptons
All I gotta say to them is thank God for that
And we could party all damn day
And the last one to stay awake
Can thank God
For my friends in the bank, friends in the Hamptons
All I gotta say to them is I'm all for that
Uh-ha, yeah uh-ha yeah uh-ha
Thank God for thatCause we'll be in the house, eating up the dominoes
Living at the top of the world, Geronimo
What the fuck you do last night, donna knows
Man I think I'm heading for a fall like a domino
Someone pick me up 'fore they kicking me down
I don't usually score - so here's the rebound
Woody Harrelson - I kept my feet on the ground
But - me and Andre Ethier really in the league now,
With no beach house
Just a sand bucket - we can shovel dreams
Or we can hitchhike and make it by other means
But if I sit tight, I'm sinking the submarine,
And sipping bubbles, I just rather sip the bubb-er-lyYes, so let the chef cook the souffle,
Eating food n liquor with my food n liquor lupe
Who'da picka better opurtun'er than a new day
Bitches tryna grabba me a bouquet,'Cause I got
Friends in the bank, friends in the Hamptons
All I gotta say to them is thank God for that
And we could party all damn day
And the last one to stay awake
Can thank God
For my friends in the bank, friends in the Hamptons
All I gotta say to them is I'm all for that
Uh-ha, yeah uh-ha yeah uh-ha
Thanks God for that'Cause I got
Friends in the bank, friends in the Hamptons
All I gotta say to them is thank God for that
And we could party all damn day
And the last one to stay awake
Can thank God
For my friends in the bank, friends in the Hamptons
All I gotta say to them is I'm all for that
Uh-ha, yeah uh-ha yeah uh-ha
Thanks God for that
hy would anyone wanna be stopping me
When I'm trynna be good
I'm just trynna be
And I feel like the whole world is sitting right down on top of me
But I'm trynna be good
I'm just trynna be in heaven
A whole lot of obstacles there in front of me
But I'm trynna be good
I'm just trynna be good
I'm just trynna be good
I'm just trynna beI want the people who made me to feel they could be proud
And I'll look back on their decisions like they pulling out
Wool over my eyelids
I thrive in the silence
I'm using my blinker signal
I'm trynna get by and
Change lanes to a different destination
It be like the longer that I wait
The less I develop patience
But hey thats natural
In a world full of entitlement
You know I'm Making Waves
What happens when the title hits?
I'll be cool with all Imma get
I'm not trynna be picky
But my fam giving me hell
Little Nicky
And I just play it straight
I wonder why you tricky
And I remember watching Stick Stickly (Watchin-watching Stick Stickly)
In my younger days and now my mom just wonders where that kid is
And I wish so bad I had an answer but I didn't
That's so wack, crack
Little when I realize
I only get one shot at a real life
I had met some girls they were real nice
But it didn't feel right
They thought I'm Pinocchio
Fuck it I'm a real guyAnd that's the state of things
Don't know what the day will bring
All that glitters isn't always made of bling
And she likes the finer things
Designer jeans, and diamond rings
I like the late night diner burgers
Fries and then a side of drinks (ching!)
Ring me up, I got minutes
Mortal Kombat, I got finished
But my aim was to be winning
And it can be so humble when you start at the beginning
Driving round the town, windows down, now you singing:
"I don't wanna be myself
I don't need none of your help"
You know that rebel same team
Dressin' up like you James Dean
Lucky that we had Bay teams
Growing up but I hate dreams
What ever had happened to my faith?
Left mainstream
Y'all killing the game
But you claimin' you been framed, please
I'm Roger Rabbit
Just swallowin' my habits
They come in small tablets
And these groupies love to grab it
No it's not magic
No it's not a game
I'm just hoping that it's different
Cause I hate when it's the same
I'm screaming to yall...Thank you, thank you, thank you
You just checked out Making Waves
Courtesy of us
The boys at Hoodie Allen

Until then we out
Yeah
You're crashing in right now
It's Making Waves
By your new favorite crew
Hoodie Allen
We gonna start it off right now
With out further ado
We're coming live to youPeople start to listen and they wonder if the beat break
I'll be rolling rich even if I rock the cheap skates
Life's a yearbook, never get a retake
And all the good times going faster than a speed date
You wonder why we late? Good question
Never thought we'd make it here now who'd guess it?
New lesson: Treat these moments like a blessin
I'm trynna find direction and you trynna GPS it
And no BSing on this roller coaster we thrilled
We just cut the line trynna get the seat filled
And now you're strapped in acting like we chilled
I know you love it when we go and let the beat build
We feel better then we ever been
I need to clear my head excedrin
I'm taking off to somewhere big and I be hoping that you getting in
But if you don't I know I'll see you when I get home
They say the road is just your favourite place to get grown
So for the people that I dissed and I led on
You can be the people that I miss when I head onI feel so high tonight
I don't wanna see the ground
Don't look down, don't look down
Life can be so simple
When living in the clouds
Don't look down
Don't look downAin't no better time than the present
Maybe if we never count the future
And I promise if I said it then I meant it
And I never meant to be the one to shoot your
Dreams down, see clouds and the sounds just opened up
And if they looking for a change then I hope it's us
I know it's tough, so is anything that's worth it
I'm making it my business to deserve itI feel so high tonight
I don't wanna see the ground
Don't look down
Don't look down
Life can be so simple
When living in the clouds
Don't look down
Don't look down
We had alot of fun, we had are little dates
The kids that went from skateboarding into lower hate
So I be training at this music at growing rate
Alex b keaton I'am never seeing the growing pains
Because I'm so awake my eyelids are mad at me
I live for family that why I got this dame degree use to be up in the libary now I handle beats
So I can be a star up in new york like Ann Marie Stahl
Ooooh life outstanding and I got pow
East bound and down me
Till I brown out ooh robert downey
If women coming at me then I'm cleaning up like bounty so whatcha going to do but the best I know cuz I been hungry on this beat in vegetable
And I can serve you up this heat
Got an extra four wall shit is extra cold
As long I stay up on this lane I'm the next to bowlGet get get big time and I want to make everything mine
So I been working on it every night
Until you just cant get enough just cant get enough
Just cant get enoughThey wanna call me up they wanna hear me speak
The kid that had to change he's phone like every week
So I be climbing up this charts till the very peak
A role model I just gotta get it theroly
Kept pain plus a little champagne for my real friends
Toss until we old yo this regis philbin
Will keep celebrating if no ones in the buliding
Flip cam fetish girls someone better film them
Cuz this life amazing and I got buzz no need for shaving
If I gave up who I blame but the people in my life who would sewer I would never make it
So I just eat it up french toast and bacon this is breakfast I don't stick my nose out I just keep my head in I can never sell out I can be efedrin bet a motherfucka that I fit like tetrisGet get get big time and I want to make everything mine
So I been working on it every night

Get get get big time and I want to make everything mine
So I been working on it every night
Until you just cant get enough just cant get enough
Just cant get enough
Unh
Pardon my small talk
Darlin' I'm all talk
They wanna fence me in, never a ballpark
We tear the walls off the Waldorf Astoria
I told my dudes to get to steppin' like Gloria
I made my case, she a slept-on jury
And when I go from deep I be like Stephen Curry
The lines'll hit you sharp, it got the teflon worried
So I told her that I cruise homes, yep like Suri
So I woke real early, grab a bagel and a glass of joe
The he-man, woman hater, I'm a Ras-a-cal
And Alfalfa, my hair stickin, it lost control
Cause I'm a rapper, but she more into the classical
Uh, no need to apologize
I'm 21, but I been dreamin bout the college life
So when she looks into her father's eyes, shouts to Eric Clapton
I'll be the director, cause I'm all about the action
You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones
Oh you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh you drive me mad
And I come right backYou say I'm spellbound
I hardly spell out
The four letters that make every girl just melt down
We on the shelf now, no Sam Goody
And when you mention other dudes, they no damn Hoodie
Unh, cause we go truly hard
Stiles like Julia
And I been gifted since a youth like I'm at Julliard
When we were younger, you were cooler, you and your friends used to rule the yard
A moment flicked by
I wish I was McFly
Marty with the sick ride
I'm able to switch time
No second guessin decisions on why I pick sides
So ex-nay, only talkin bout my insides
Always up to somethin, so we annually home
This song is dedicated to my January Jones
And it's a Space Jam, they say that I'm Michael
Lovin' under twenty's a cycle
So here we go
You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones
Oh you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh you drive me mad
And I come right backI throw my hand out, I'm tryna help her up
She lookin back at me, I think you helped enough
Ain't havin none of it, you gonna sit and say
No love for triple A
Okay, she's gone away
You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones
Oh you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh you drive me mad
And I come right back
