Thank you for being a friend, traveled down the road and back again
Your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant
I'm not ashamed to say, I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off won't you stand up and take a bow
And if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew
Well you would see the biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
If it's a car you lack, I'd surely buy you a Cadillac
Whatever you need any time of the day and night
I'm not ashamed to say, I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off, won't you stand up and take a bow
And when we both get older
With walking canes and hair of gray
Have no fear even though it's hard to hear
I will stand real close and say
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Let me tell about a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
And when we die and float away
Into the night, the Milky Way
You'll hear me call as we ascend
I'll say your name, then once again
Thank you for being a
Thank you for being a
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
People let me tell about a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Tell about a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
