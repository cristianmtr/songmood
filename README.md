# Haddockify

A text analyser which uses sentiment analysis to decide if the lyrics for a song are positive, negative or neutral.

Has nothing to do with Captain Haddock.

This project was created for the course Artificial Intelligence at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) by Adrian Blanco, Casper Winsnes, Hampus Liljekvist and Isak Nilsson.
